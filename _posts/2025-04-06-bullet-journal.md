On October 2023, my 3-month-old son was diagnosed with mitral valve regurgitation. We ended up staying almost 4 months in the children’s hospital before he got released. Luckily enough, I was able to work remotely, and during my spare time, I encountered bullet journaling. I found it very fascinating and got hooked. I bought myself a Leuchtturm 1917 journal and Drehgriffel Nr. 1 pen from Amazon. I noted my daily activities in the hospital, work, and hobbies. So it went like this...

Is it worth it? For me, it is. I get to keep track of my life in a single analog journal. My phone is usually a trap for doom scrolling. I have multiple calendars, so I can sync them all in one place. Moreover, if I’m busy on a particular day, I can quickly glance in my journal. I predict that my future will be laborious. This method has so far provided a contractual commitment to getting things done. To maximize the effectiveness of this system, I purchased and read The Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carroll. One of my favorite productivity books.
