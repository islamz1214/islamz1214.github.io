            My first time writing javascript. This was a project in SCSU for course CSC 443. Funny thing was, my professor would teach us JS with netscape logo in ppt slides (so outdated, haha). Anyhow, I got a good taste of this language. I would say the coolest feature I had learned was the mouseover effect. It allowed me to preview the score before confirming with a click.
