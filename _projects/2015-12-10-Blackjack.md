             I wasn't serious when I first took Java in SCSU. Explains why I had a "C". During my sophmore/junior year, I became serious about my craft and retook Java. So this was my final project for CSC 153, which I got an "A" for the course. I had only 3 class files and they were large. After graduation, I told myself I would refactor to make it clean and finally I did. Also wrote unit tests which I found very helpful.
