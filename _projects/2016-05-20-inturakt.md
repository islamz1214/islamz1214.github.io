            I worked on this during my final semester in SCSU. It was my final personal project for the A100 apprenticeship program. This project was built using Meteor JS framework v1.3.4. This full stack application uses mongodb as the database. It was a fun project, I felt accomplished to build something from scratch, host on a heroku server, and demo infront of clients for interviews. Although I didn't make the cut for some of the jobs in CT, I made my move to Revature (best decision ever). This application allows you to make an acccount, create both private and/or public chatrooms, send direct message to another user and much more. For bonus, I added an extra feature, where users can send random giphy messages (leveraged giphy api).
